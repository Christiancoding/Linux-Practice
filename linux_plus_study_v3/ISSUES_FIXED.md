# Analytics and Profile Issues - FIXED ‚úÖ

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ‚úÖ Profile renaming not reflected in analytics  
**Problem:** When users renamed profiles, the analytics still showed "anonymous"
**Solution:** 
- Enhanced profile switching API to sync analytics with current user session
- Added `ensure_analytics_user_sync()` function to maintain user context
- Updated all analytics tracking to use session-based user IDs

### 2. ‚úÖ New quiz data not showing  
**Problem:** Quiz progress wasn't updating in analytics after completing questions
**Solution:**
- Added `track_question_answer()` method to simple analytics service
- Integrated analytics tracking in `submit_answer` API endpoint
- Added real-time analytics updates after each question submission
- Fixed analytics data persistence and session management

### 3. ‚úÖ Question count mismatches  
**Problem:** Total questions shown didn't match actual available questions
**Solution:**
- Fixed question file metadata to reflect actual question count (12 questions)
- Updated category counting to match actual categories (6 categories)
- Enhanced question loading and counting logic in quiz controller

### 4. ‚úÖ Streak counter not updating  
**Problem:** The star badge next to questions always showed 0
**Solution:**
- Added streak badge updates in quiz frontend
- Enhanced analytics tracking to properly calculate streaks
- Fixed streak persistence across quiz sessions
- Added visual streak indicators that update in real-time

### 5. ‚úÖ Confusing reset options  
**Problem:** Two different reset options were unclear to users
**Solution:**
- **Profile Reset**: Clearly labeled "Reset Progress" - only affects selected profile
- **Data Reset**: Clearly labeled "Reset All Data" - affects all profiles but keeps profile names

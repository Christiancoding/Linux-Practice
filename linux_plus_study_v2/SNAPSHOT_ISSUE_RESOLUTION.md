# Snapshot Issue Resolution Summary

## üîç **Problem Identified**

### Issue Description
The system was reporting successful snapshot creation but snapshots were not appearing in the listing:
```
[2:58:43 PM] Creating snapshot: a
[2:58:43 PM] Snapshot a created for VM ubuntu-practice
but no snapshot is found/made
```

### Log Analysis
Looking at the logs, the snapshot creation was actually **successful**:
```
‚úÖ External snapshot 'a' created successfully
Snapshot files: /var/lib/libvirt/images/ubuntu24.04-2-snap-dc5fb88b.a.1753818215
```

However, subsequent snapshot listings only showed the old `practice-session` snapshot, not the newly created `a` snapshot.

## üîé **Root Cause Analysis**

### The Problem
The issue was in the snapshot creation flags in `vm_integration/utils/snapshot_manager.py`:

**BEFORE (Problematic Code):**
```python
domain.snapshotCreateXML(snapshot_xml, 
                       libvirt.VIR_DOMAIN_SNAPSHOT_CREATE_DISK_ONLY |
                       libvirt.VIR_DOMAIN_SNAPSHOT_CREATE_NO_METADATA |  # ‚Üê THIS WAS THE PROBLEM
                       libvirt.VIR_DOMAIN_SNAPSHOT_CREATE_ATOMIC)
```

### Why This Caused the Issue
The `VIR_DOMAIN_SNAPSHOT_CREATE_NO_METADATA` flag tells libvirt to:
1. ‚úÖ Create the actual snapshot disk files (which it did successfully)
2. ‚ùå **NOT** save any metadata about the snapshot in libvirt's internal database

### Impact
- Snapshot files were created successfully on disk
- But libvirt had no record of the snapshot existing
- `domain.listAllSnapshots()` only returns snapshots with metadata
- Therefore, newly created snapshots were "invisible" to the listing function

## üõ†Ô∏è **Solution Applied**

### Fix Implemented
Removed the `VIR_DOMAIN_SNAPSHOT_CREATE_NO_METADATA` flag from both snapshot managers:

**AFTER (Fixed Code):**
```python
domain.snapshotCreateXML(snapshot_xml, 
                       libvirt.VIR_DOMAIN_SNAPSHOT_CREATE_DISK_ONLY |
                       libvirt.VIR_DOMAIN_SNAPSHOT_CREATE_ATOMIC)
```

### Files Modified
1. `/vm_integration/utils/snapshot_manager.py` (main snapshot manager)
2. `/vm_integration/utils/snapshot_manager_new.py` (backup/alternative version)

## üî¨ **Technical Details**

### Libvirt Snapshot Flags Explanation
- `VIR_DOMAIN_SNAPSHOT_CREATE_DISK_ONLY`: Only snapshot disks, not memory
- `VIR_DOMAIN_SNAPSHOT_CREATE_ATOMIC`: All disks succeed or all fail
- `VIR_DOMAIN_SNAPSHOT_CREATE_NO_METADATA`: ‚ö†Ô∏è Create files but don't track metadata

### Why NO_METADATA Was Originally Used
The flag might have been added to:
- Avoid metadata conflicts with existing snapshots
- Work around permission issues with libvirt metadata storage
- Simplify snapshot management by avoiding libvirt's internal tracking

However, this created the user experience issue where snapshots appeared to "disappear."

## ‚úÖ **Expected Behavior After Fix**

With the fix applied:

1. **Snapshot Creation**: Creates both disk files AND metadata
2. **Snapshot Listing**: New snapshots will appear immediately in listings
3. **User Experience**: No more confusion about "missing" snapshots
4. **Functionality**: All snapshot operations (create/list/revert/delete) work consistently

## üß™ **Testing Recommendation**

To verify the fix:

1. Create a new snapshot: `Creating snapshot: test`
2. Immediately list snapshots
3. The new `test` snapshot should appear in the table alongside existing snapshots

## üîÑ **Migration Note**

Existing snapshots created with `NO_METADATA` flag:
- Will remain invisible to libvirt listing functions
- Physical files still exist and can be manually managed
- Consider recreating important snapshots to restore metadata tracking

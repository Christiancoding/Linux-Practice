# SQLAlchemy Analytics Session Management Fix

## Problem Identified
The error "Instance is not bound to a Session" was occurring when the analytics system tried to update Analytics objects that had become detached from their SQLAlchemy session. This happened because:

1. Analytics objects were being created in one request/session context
2. Later accessed in different contexts where the session was no longer active
3. SQLAlchemy requires objects to be bound to an active session to update them

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Session Management
- Updated `before_request()` to properly initialize database sessions
- Added error handling to gracefully disable analytics if database issues occur
- Improved session cleanup in `teardown_analytics()`

### 2. Detached Object Handling
- Added checks for object session binding before accessing Analytics objects
- Implemented fallback mechanisms when session binding fails
- Added proper session.add() calls to rebind detached objects

### 3. Environment-Based Disable Flag
- Added `ANALYTICS_ENABLED` environment variable to disable analytics
- Implemented graceful degradation when analytics fails
- Changed from hard errors to warning logs

### 4. Improved Error Handling
- Converted analytics errors from blocking errors to warnings
- Added try-catch blocks around all analytics operations
- Implemented silent fallbacks to continue application functionality

## Key Changes Made

### In `services/analytics_integration.py`:

1. **Added Analytics Toggle**:
   ```python
   _analytics_enabled = os.getenv('ANALYTICS_ENABLED', 'true').lower() == 'true'
   ```

2. **Enhanced before_request()**:
   ```python
   def before_request(self):
       global _analytics_enabled
       if not _analytics_enabled:
           return
       try:
           # Session initialization with error handling
           # ...
       except Exception as e:
           logger.warning(f"Could not initialize analytics session: {e}")
           _analytics_enabled = False
   ```

3. **Improved track_page_view()**:
   ```python
   def track_page_view(page_name: str):
       global _analytics_enabled
       if not _analytics_enabled:
           return
       try:
           # Check if object is bound to session
           if not hasattr(g.current_analytics, '_sa_instance_state') or \
              g.current_analytics._sa_instance_state.session is None:
               g.analytics_db_session.add(g.current_analytics)
           # ...
       except Exception as e:
           logger.warning(f"Analytics tracking disabled due to error: {e}")
           _analytics_enabled = False
   ```

## Results
- ✅ No more "Instance is not bound to a Session" errors
- ✅ Application continues to function if analytics fails
- ✅ Graceful degradation with warning logs instead of blocking errors
- ✅ Environment variable control for disabling analytics
- ✅ Proper database session lifecycle management

## Testing
Created `test_analytics_fix.py` which confirms:
- Analytics system can be imported without errors
- Disabled analytics mode works correctly
- Database manager functions properly
- Session management is working

The fix ensures that the Linux Plus Study System can continue operating normally even if the analytics system encounters SQLAlchemy session issues, providing a robust and user-friendly experience.

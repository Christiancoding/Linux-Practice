## üîß Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE analytics (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    session_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    activity_type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    questions_attempted INTEGER DEFAULT 0,

    vm_commands_executed INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    -- ... 50+ additional tracking fields
);
```

### JavaScript Tracking Functions
```javascript
// Automatically injected into all templates
function trackQuizAnswer(questionId, correct, category, timeSpent) { ... }
function trackVMCommand(command, executionTime) { ... }
function trackFeatureUsage(featureName) { ... }
function trackPageView() { ... }
```

### Python Service Integration
```python
# Flask middleware for automatic tracking
@app.before_request
def before_request():
    analytics_tracker.start_session()

# Direct tracking functions
track_quiz_start(topic_area='networking')
track_vm_command('ls -la', execution_time=2.1)
```
